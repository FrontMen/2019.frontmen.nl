    <h2>100% Agile</h2>
    <p>
      Our agile method enables us to be fast and flexible in finding the very best solutions together with our clients. We
      work in three-week sprints. After this short period we deliver a working component, which we make available to the
      end user to take for a test ride. The feedback is then used to make improvements.
    </p>
    <h2>Component Library</h2>
    <p>
      Even after the (web) app has been delivered, it is crucial for your organization to be able to implement new functionality
      quickly, all the while preserving the quality of the code. That’s why, for large projects, we put together a Components
      Library containing all bits and pieces of code. This allows you to create high-quality software independently, at any
      time, and to significantly reduce the time it takes to get from idea to end product.
