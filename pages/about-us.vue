      Knowledge development is central to our company. There is no leaning back when youâ€™re a front-runner in a hyper-dynamic
      branch. We organize workshops, congresses and meet-ups to bring our own developers, clients and the growing
      frontend community in the Netherlands up to speed with the latest developments.
